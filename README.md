The above assignment was performed on city bike system  data available at https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data.
For the above assignment the data chosen is between october 2018 to september 2019.
The assignment consist of 12 visualisations in total,2 dashboards,1 story and 3 maps.There is a .twbx workbook with all the plots,please use the arrow sign at the bottom of the workbook to view all the plots.
The following analysis were performed on the above data-


## Count of the trip from October 2018 to September 2019
The total number of trips during the above time interval was 386,200

## Ratio between subscriber and customers yearwise/monthly

The graph indicates that there are more subscribers than normal customers  every year/month which could mean that people prefer to take an annual subscription.Also the total number of usertype declines during the summer months and increases in the winters.

The graph shows the top 10 stations for start journey.On hover over each circle shows the total number of records for each station

 Similarly the graph below shows the top 10 stations for end journey

### Trip duration for each bike id and trip duration
similarly the total trip duration for each bike id was calculated showing the bike which was used the most 
We also know the type of subscriber for each bikeid from the graph

#### Maps with bike stations for start and end journey.
A comparision of these maps show that there are more stations for end journey as compared to the start journey stations
The color variation in the map shows the popuratity of the stations with the red ones more popular

### Gender ratio plots 
These plots show the ratio of male and female users between October 2018 and september 2019.1 and 2 represent male and female respectively.In the area plot it is seen that the number of male bike users is greater than the female bike users.But the trend of both male and female bike users is similar over the years/months sjowing a decline in summers.

Again the box and whisker plot shows the median values,upper extreme and lower extreme for both male and female users.Te median for male users is 1.6 times greater than the female users.
