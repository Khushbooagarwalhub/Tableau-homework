 On hover over each circle shows the total number of records for each station
 
 Similarly the graph below shows the top 10 stations for end journey

### Trip duration for each bike id and trip duration
similarly the total trip duration for each bike id was calculated showing the bike which was used the most 
We also know the type of subscriber for each bikeid from the graph

     height='400'
     src='plots and dashboards/trip duration and user type.png'> 
     
     
     
#### There are also maps with bike stations for start and end journey.
A comparision of these maps show that there are more stations for end journey as compared to the start journey stations
